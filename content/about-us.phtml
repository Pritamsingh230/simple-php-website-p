<b>Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) in software development. 
  Jenkins helps automate parts of the software development process, primarily focusing on building, testing, and deploying applications. 
  It is highly extensible through a wide range of plugins, making it adaptable to various development workflows and toolchains.</b>
<b> Continuous Integration (CI):

CI is a development practice where developers frequently integrate code into a shared repository. Each integration (or code commit) is automatically verified by running tests, ensuring that new code changes do not break the existing build.
Jenkins automates this process by continuously pulling code changes from a repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket) and triggering build and test processes.
Continuous Delivery (CD):

CD extends CI by automating the deployment of applications to production or other environments. Jenkins pipelines allow you to automate the entire software delivery lifecycle, from build to test to deploy.</b>'
