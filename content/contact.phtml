<b>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular, open-source, server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. 
  It is especially suited for creating dynamic web pages and applications, handling server-side tasks like form processing,
  database interactions, session management, and more.</b> 
<b>Key Features of PHP:
Server-Side Scripting:

PHP code runs on the server, and the output is sent to the clientâ€™s web browser, typically in HTML format. This makes PHP well-suited for creating dynamic content on websites.
For example, PHP can be used to fetch data from a database and display it dynamically on a webpage.
Embedded in HTML:

PHP can be easily embedded within HTML, making it simple for developers to add server-side logic directly into their web pages.</b>
