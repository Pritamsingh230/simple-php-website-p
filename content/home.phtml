<b>When using PHP, Docker, and Jenkins together, you can achieve a streamlined and automated workflow for developing, testing, and deploying PHP applications in a consistent and portable environment.</b>
<b>Key Concepts:
PHP:

PHP is the server-side scripting language used to develop the application. It runs on a web server (like Apache or Nginx) and processes requests to generate dynamic web content.
PHP code can be packaged and deployed in a Docker container, providing consistency across different environments.</b>
<b>Docker:

Docker is a platform that allows you to containerize your PHP application. A container bundles the application code, runtime, dependencies (such as libraries), and configurations, ensuring that the application behaves the same across various environments.
Using Docker, you can create a Dockerfile that defines how the PHP application, along with web servers (Apache or Nginx), should be packaged and run in a container.
Docker Compose can also be used to manage multi-container setups, such as when your PHP application interacts with a database (MySQL or PostgreSQL) or other services.</b>

<b>Jenkins:

Jenkins is an automation server widely used for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). It automates tasks such as code integration, testing, building Docker images, and deploying applications.
Jenkins integrates with Docker to build Docker images for your PHP application, run tests inside containers, and deploy the containers to production.</b>
