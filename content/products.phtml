<b>Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. 
  A Docker container packages an application and its dependencies (e.g., libraries, frameworks, etc.) into a single executable unit, 
  ensuring that the application can run consistently across different environments (e.g., on a developerâ€™s laptop, on servers in the cloud, or in data centers).</b>
<b>
  Key Concepts of Docker:
  
Containers:

Containers are isolated environments where an application and its dependencies run. 
  Containers use fewer resources than traditional virtual machines because they share the host system's OS kernel, while still maintaining their own file system, processes, and network interfaces.
Docker Image:

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software (code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, etc.). 
  Containers are instances of Docker images.
Images are built from a Dockerfile, which specifies the application's dependencies, environment setup, and commands to run.</b>
